# Introduction 
This is part of the LISA-project that we did for Vitalis (de Wilgenhof), a retirement home in Eindhoven. This frontend, Vitalis Menu Editor, allows the chefs and staffs to add and edit the menu.

# Overview

The main functionalities: 
- Add new dishes by type
- Design menu for a specific date by choosing from the existing dishes
- Export menu as PDF


The frontend is connected to the database on localhost:5000. 
The accompanying Google Assistant app uses Dialogflow for user interaction, and it is connected to the backend with webhooks.
